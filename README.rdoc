== Blockenspiel

Blockenspiel is a helper library designed to make it easy to implement DSL
blocks. It is designed to be comprehensive and robust, supporting most common
usage patterns, and working correctly in the presence of nested blocks and
multithreading.

=== Summary

Blockenspiel is a helper library providing several different strategies for
implementing DSL blocks. It supports both DSLs that take a block parameter
and those that do not. For example:

 # Call DSL block with parameter
 configure_me do |config|
   config.add_foo(1)
   config.add_bar(2)
 end

 # Call DSL block without parameter
 configure_me do
   add_foo(3)
   add_bar(4)
 end

To support the above usage, you can do this:

 # Implement DSL block methods
 class ConfigMethods
   include Blockenspiel::DSL
   def add_foo(value)
     # do something
   end
   def add_bar(value)
     # do something
   end
 end

 # Implement configure_me method
 def configure_me(&block)
   Blockenspiel.invoke(block, ConfigMethods.new)
 end

By default, Blockenspiel uses a "delegation" technique (to my knowledge first
proposed by Dan Manges) to support parameterless blocks while mitigating some
of the issues with <tt>instance_eval</tt>. It supports nested blocks and
multithreaded access, and provides a variety of tools for handling the
typical issues you may encounter when writing DSLs. On some ruby platforms,
Blockenspiel also supports a mixin technique (proposed by Why The Lucky Stiff).

=== Requirements

* Ruby 1.9.3 or later, JRuby 1.5 or later, or Rubinius 1.0 or later.

=== Installation

 gem install blockenspiel

=== Known issues and to-do items

* Implementing wildcard DSL methods using <tt>method_missing</tt> doesn't
  work. I haven't yet decided on the right semantics for this case, or
  whether it is even a reasonable feature at all.
* Including Blockenspiel::DSL in a module (rather than a class) is not
  supported, but this could appear in a future release.
* Find a way to implement mixin behavior reliably on MRI.

=== Author / Credits

Blockenspiel is written by Daniel Azuma (http://www.daniel-azuma.com/).

The mixin implementation is based on a concept by the late Why The Lucky
Stiff, documented in his 6 October 2008 blog posting entitled "Mixing Our
Way Out Of Instance Eval?". The original link has disappeared along with
its author, but you may find copies or mirrors out there.

The unmixer code is based on {Mixology}[http://rubyforge.org/projects/mixology],
version by Patrick Farley, anonymous z, Dan Manges, and Clint Bishop.
The JRuby code is adapted from Mixology 0.1, and has been stripped down and
modified to support JRuby >= 1.2. The Rubinius code was adapted from unreleased
code in the Mixology source tree and modified to support Rubinius 1.0. I know
Mixology 0.2 is now available, but its Rubinius support is not active, and I'd
rather keep the unmixer bundled with Blockenspiel for now to reduce
dependencies. Earlier versions of Blockenspiel also included a C extension,
adapted from Mixology, to support mixins for MRI, but this code has been
disabled due to issues with newer versions of Ruby.

The dsl_attr_writer and dsl_attr_accessor feature came from a suggestion by
Luis Lavena.
